# Symbol Playbooks

Each playbook wraps baseline strategies with asset-specific overlays.

## XAUUSD
- Focus on London/NY overlap; require relative volume percentile > 70.
- Wider ATR stops (â‰¥2.5x) and strict news halts around US data.
- Sentiment veto from economic headlines is mandatory for high-impact releases.

## US100
- Opening range breakout emphasis; pay attention to pre-market highs/lows.
- Slippage guard uses transaction cost analytics to reduce size during volatility spikes.
- Tape aggression weighting increased when futures lead equities.

## BTCUSD
- Distinguish between range and breakout regimes with adaptive fee/spread guard.
- Sentiment weight increased using crypto-specific feeds and social signals.
- 24/7 session model prevents overnight assumption errors.

## GBPJPY
- Wider stops and smaller base size due to volatility; avoid trading around BoE/BoJ news.
- Range scalper disabled during macro weeks flagged by calendar feed.

## EURUSD
- Exploit tight spreads with mean-reversion bias; prefer limit entries at range extremes.
- Quick break-even adjustments to preserve edge.
